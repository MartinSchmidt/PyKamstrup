This is an implementation of the Kamstrup Meter Protocol (KMP) based
on reverse engineering of a traffic dump.

There is very little information about this protocol on the net, and
despite calling it an "open protocol", Kamstrup has not wanted to
release the documentation for it to me.

Tested on a Kamstrup 382J electricity-meter using a home-built
optical head.

Enjoy,
